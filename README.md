[**libjdk**](https://github.com/libjdk/libjdk) is a comprehensive C++ implementation of the Java Development Kit (JDK), providing native C++ libraries that mirror the functionality of Java's core libraries and modules. While it provides Java-like APIs, it runs as native C++ code without requiring a Java Virtual Machine.

This library specifically focuses on the Java Security SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) module, which implements the SASL framework for Java. SASL is a framework for authentication and security services in network protocols, commonly used in protocols like IMAP, SMTP, and LDAP.
